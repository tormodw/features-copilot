# Home Automation System

A modular, event-driven C++ system for home automation based on multiple sensor inputs, energy cost optimization, and **machine learning-based day-ahead scheduling**.

## Features

### Sensor Integration
- **Energy Meters**: Monitor real-time energy consumption
- **Temperature Sensors**: Indoor and outdoor temperature monitoring
- **Solar Production Sensors**: Track solar panel energy production
- **EV Charger Sensors**: Monitor electric vehicle charging status

### Communication Protocol
- **MQTT Integration**: Real-time communication with sensors and appliances
- **HTTP API**: Fetch hourly energy costs from external services

### Appliance Control
The system manages various appliances intelligently:
- **Heaters**: Automatic temperature control
- **Air Conditioners**: Cooling based on temperature and energy cost
- **Lights**: Brightness adjustment for energy savings
- **Curtains**: Passive temperature management
- **EV Chargers**: Smart charging based on energy costs and solar production

### Decision-Making Logic
The energy optimizer minimizes energy consumption while maintaining user comfort:
1. **Cost-based optimization**: Stop/adjust operations during high electricity costs
2. **Solar utilization**: Leverage solar production for usage planning
3. **Temperature maintenance**: Ensure efficient heating/cooling
4. **Passive strategies**: Use curtains for thermal management

### Machine Learning Day-Ahead Optimization
**NEW**: The system now includes ML-based predictive optimization:
- **Historical Data Learning**: Trains on 30+ days of energy cost, solar production, and temperature patterns
- **24-Hour Forecasting**: Predicts next day's energy costs, solar availability, and weather
- **Optimal Scheduling**: Generates hourly schedule to minimize costs while maintaining comfort
- **Smart EV Charging**: Identifies the 4 best hours for charging (lowest cost, highest solar)
- **Pre-heating/Cooling**: Conditions home during low-cost hours to reduce peak-hour usage
- **Cost Estimation**: Provides estimated daily energy cost and consumption

## Architecture

### Event-Driven Design
- **EventManager**: Central event bus for component communication
- **Event Types**: Temperature changes, energy updates, cost updates, etc.
- **Subscribers**: Components subscribe to relevant events

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make

# Run the application
./home_automation
```

## Usage Example

The system automatically:
1. **Trains ML model** on historical energy data (30 days)
2. **Generates day-ahead schedule** predicting optimal appliance usage for next 24 hours
3. **Monitors sensor inputs** via MQTT in real-time
4. **Fetches current energy costs** from HTTP API
5. **Makes intelligent decisions** to optimize energy usage
6. **Controls appliances** based on:
   - Day-ahead schedule recommendations
   - Current energy cost
   - Solar production levels
   - Indoor/outdoor temperatures
   - User comfort requirements

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: ML Day-Ahead Optimization**
- ML predicts energy costs will be high from 7am-10pm
- System schedules EV charging for 4 optimal hours (10am-1pm when solar is high)
- Pre-heats home during low-cost night hours (0am-6am)
- Minimizes HVAC during predicted high-cost periods
- Estimated daily cost: $11.67 for 60 kWh consumption

**Scenario 2: High Energy Cost (Real-time)**
- System stops EV charging when electricity is expensive
- Reduces lighting brightness
- Minimizes HVAC usage if temperature is acceptable

**Scenario 3: High Solar Production (Real-time)**
- Prioritizes energy-intensive tasks (EV charging, heating)
- Opens curtains to utilize solar heat
- Runs appliances on solar power

**Scenario 4: Temperature Control**
- Turns on heater when indoor temperature drops below target
- Activates AC when temperature exceeds target
- Closes curtains to block external heat

## Day-Ahead Schedule Example

```
Hour 0:00-6:00 (Night - Low Cost)
  - EV Charger: Defer (not optimal)
  - Heater: Pre-heat to 23°C (save on peak hours)

Hour 10:00-13:00 (Midday - High Solar)
  - EV Charger: Charge at 11kW (optimal hours)
  - Solar production: 6-8 kW available

Hour 7:00-22:00 (Day - High Cost)
  - HVAC: Minimize usage
  - Use pre-heated/cooled thermal mass
```
